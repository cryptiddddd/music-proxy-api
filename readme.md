## What is it?

Wormboy's Music Proxy API is a [restful api](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/RESTful-API) intended for use in client-facing applications (for example, static websites such [Neocities](https://neocities.org)). It provides the user with raw [JSON-formatted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON#json_structure) data, which they may format as they like.

In short, it is similar to [volt.fm](https://volt.fm), only it trades depth of statistical analysis for user customizability.

[See example uses here](docs/examples.md)


## Who is it for?

The inspiration behind this tool is Neocities, a combination static site host and social media. The community of webmasters on Neocities are using HTML/CSS/JS for self-expression. With the popularity of Spotify, I believe that creating a protected interface with Spotify could be a fun way to share a little part of oneself.

This API is a beginner or hobbyist developer's tool.
